## Goal
There are two main goals that we hope to achieve by using containers:
- Reproducibility, and
- Portability.

That is: given the same inputs, we want our workflow to produce the same outputs, on any computer, now and forever.
Anyone who has tried to run their workflow on multiple computers, upgrade their OS, or help a colleague to use your workflow, will no doubt understand just how hard this is.

## Containers
Containerization is a way to bundle your software in such a way that you no longer have to deal with complex dependency chains, supporting multiple OSs, or software version conflicts.
Containers provide a way to package software in an isolated environment which may even have a different operating system from the host.

Containers are different from virtual machines (VMs) in a few key ways.
Using a virtual machine is like running your operating system on virtualized (think "simulated") hardware.
A VM will then run a guest operating system on this hardware, and thus needs all of the resources that an OS would need.
A VM will additionally contain all the software that you want to run within the guest operating system.
A container works by virtualizing the operating system instead of the hardware.
Thus a container doesn't need an entire operating system worth of data/config, but only the software that you want to run within that operating system.
A virtual machine will typically persist state/data between runs (for better or worse), whilst a container will not.
Each time you run a container you get that new car smell.

The two most popular containerization systems are [Singularity/Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
Docker is primarily used on computers where you have root access such as your laptop/desktop or a compute node in the cloud.
HPC facilities will not use Docker as it provides root access to the host system, and instead will use Singularity which does not.

The two systems are largely interoperable - you can build a Docker container on your desktop, test it out in your workflow, and then convert it to a Singularity image for use on your HPC facility of choice.
You can think of a container as a self contained operating system which you can build with all the software that you need, which you can then deploy on any computer that you like.
In fact you don’t even need to know how to build the containers to use them as there are many available pre-built containers that you can use.
Both systems provide an online repository for storing built containers: Docker has [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/), while Singularity uses [Singularity Container Services (SCS)](https://cloud.sylabs.io/).

![DockerLogo]({{page.root}}{% link fig/Docker_logo.png%}){: width='100' align='left'}
Docker is easy to build, and can use on any computer where you have root access.
Docker has clients for Linux, Windows, and MacOS, so it meets our portability requirement with ease.
There are a large number of ready made containers that you can use as a starting point for your own container, available on docker hub.
Often you don't even need to make your own container, you can just use an existing one right out of the box.
Docker requires that you have a docker service running to manage all the images.


![SingularityLogo]({{page.root}}{% link fig/Singularity.png%}){: width='100' align='left'}
Singularity easy to use and doesn’t require root access, but it's only available for Linux based machines.
Singularity images are stored as files which you can easily move from one system/location to another, and you don't need a service to be running in order to use the images.


Our recommendation is to use both of these solutions in conjunction: Docker to build/test/run containers on your local machine, and then Singularity to run containers on an HPC.
A really convenient feature of the two systems is that Docker containers can be converted into Singularity containers with minimal effort.
In fact, some smart cookie created [a docker container](https://quay.io/repository/singularity/docker2singularity?tab=tags&tag=latest), with singularity installed within, that will automatically convert your docker containers into singularity containers.
Therefore you don't even need to install Singularity on your local machine in order to produce singularity images.


## Using containers
There are a large range of pre-built containers available on [docker-hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&image_filter=official).
These range from base operating systems like Ubuntu, Alpine, or Debian to application containers like redis, postgres or mysql, to language containers like python, java, or golang.
There is even a docker container for docker itself!

We will begin our journey by working with the "Hello World" docker container.

The `hello-world` container is very minimal and does only one thing.

We can be more adventurous and do interactive things with containers.
Let's start with the `ubuntu` container, which contains a naked install of Ubuntu.

> ## bash the container
> ~~~
> $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
> Explore the container system, look at what software/libraries are available, and share your results in the [etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/ADACS_NextFlow).

> > root@f13326d08c8a:/#
> > ~~~
> > {: .output}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

When we called `docker run` above we specified the `-it` options which are short for `--interactive` and `--tty` which means that we'll get an interactive container and a tty (shell-like) interface.
By calling the container name `ubuntu` followed by the command `bash` we will run the `bash` command within the container.
You'll see that your command line changes to something like `root@1234abc:/#`.
If you run a command like `apt list` or `ls /usr/bin` you'll see software/libraries that are available to you.
This ubuntu install is quite minimal and doesn't include any desktop features (it's not a VM!).

When we are working within a container we should be mindful that the contents of the container are ephemeral.
If we change any of the container contents while it's running, these changes will be lost when the container shuts down.
So whilst you could run the `ubuntu` container, install some software you wanted, and then run that software, you would need to reinstall it every time you ran the container.
We'll see how to build containers with the software that we require in the next section.

Containers are setup to be isolated from the host operating system, so that whilst you are within a container (eg you are running `docker -it ubuntu bash`) you cannot see files or run programs from the host operating system.
Any accidental/nefarious things you do within the container are "safe".
However, if you have a script that you want to run, let's call it `do_things.py`, and you want it to run with the version of Python inside a docker container you need to find some way to get that script from your local machine into the container.

There are two ways to go about this:
1. You can copy a file from your local machine into a (running) docker container using `docker cp [OPTIONS] CONTAINER:SRC_PATH DEST_PATH`
2. You can mount part of your local file system to a location within the container using `docker run --mount [OPTIONS] CONTAINER`

The first option can also be used to copy files *from* the container to your local machine.

The second option is often best when you are developing code that needs to run within the container because you can use your favorite IDE on your local machine to work on the files, and then run them within the container without having to constantly copy things back and forth.

> ## Mount a local directory into your container
>  On your machine, `touch` a new file called `do_things.py` and add the following:
> ~~~
> #! /usr/bin/env python
> import socket
> print(f"Hello from {socket.gethostname()}")
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> Now run:
> ~~~
> docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/app python:3.8.5 bash
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
> Navigate to the `/app` directory and run `python do_things.py`
>
> Share your hello message in the [etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/ADACS_NextFlow).
{: .challenge}

In the above exercise you should see that the host name is some random string of letters and numbers, which is (hopefully) different from your local machines name.
Note that when we are working inside the container we are working as `root`, which means we have *all the privileges*.
If you bind a local path to one inside the container, then you'll have `root` access to that path.
So it's a good idea **not** to mount `/` inside the container!
Being `root` user inside the container also means that any files which you create in the mounted directory will be owned by root on your local machine.
Having root privileges within the container is a big reason why you wont see docker being provided on an HPC.

## Managing containers
Docker will keep all your images and containers organized for you but in a little bit of a hidden way.

To see the images that you have available use `docker images`.
And you'll get a listing similar to below:
~~~
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                           TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
test                                 latest    98ba6115a75f   3 weeks ago     882MB
ubuntu                               latest    216c552ea5ba   5 weeks ago     77.8MB
python                               3.9       4819be0df942   8 months ago    912MB
hello-world                          latest    feb5d9fea6a5   13 months ago   13.3kB
python                               3.8.5     28a4c88cdbbf   2 years ago     882MB
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The `REPOSITORY:TAG` is how you can refer to a particular version of a container.
You can also use the `IMAGE ID` locally to refer to a container.
Note the different sizes of the containers: `hello-world` is tiny because it does only one thing, `ubuntu` is 78MB and is the bare-bones you need to run ubuntu, but then `python:3.9` is nearly 1GB as it has a lot of different software installed within.

These are just the containers that you have locally, and they may not be running.
To see the **running** containers you can use `docker ps` which will show the containers that are running.
If this is your first time running Docker containers then you'll probably have no running containers, however sometimes you'll run a container in detached mode (with `docker run -d`) which lets the container sit in the background and provide a service (usually some API or web site or a db connection).
It's easy to forget about these running containers, so an occasional `docker ps` can show you what is running.
If you want to stop a container you can find it's `CONTAINER ID` (not image id) from `docker ps` and then run `docker stop <id>`.

Managing docker containers (and networks and volumes) can be tricky, and usually people use a manager such as [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), to define container interactions and set up networks etc.
We will not get further into managing container because, you guessed it, NextFlow can do this for us.


## Building (docker) containers
As well as using pre-made containers, you can build your own.
Whilst it's possible to build a container from scratch, it's recommended that you start with a base layer and then add in what you need.
In many ways, building a container is like installing software on your computer, except that you don't have an interactive prompt.
If you can install software on your computer from the command line then you can build a docker container.

A few things to note:
- Containers are built in layers, with each layer being a container of it's own.
- It is often best to start with a container that does most of what you want rather than something "empty" like `Ubuntu`.
- Whatever files you put into the container during the build process will remain there during deployment.

Docker containers are built according to instructions in a `Dockerfile`.
Below is an example docker file which is used to build a container for a project called [Robbie](https://github.com/PaulHancock/Robbie):
~~~
# Start with a container that already has Python v3.9 installed
FROM python:3.9

# Set some meta-data about this container
LABEL maintainer="Paul Hancock <paul.hancock@curtin.edu.au>"

# install non-python dependencies
RUN apt update && \
    apt install -y openjdk-11-jdk swarp && \
    apt-get autoremove -y && \ # autoremove and clean will get rid of not-needed libraries and reduce the container size (a bit)
    apt-get clean

# download a java library and make a wrapper script for it
RUN cd /usr/local/lib && wget http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/stilts/stilts.jar && \
    cd /usr/local/bin && echo 'java -jar /usr/local/lib/stilts.jar "$@"' > /usr/local/bin/stilts && chmod ugo+x /usr/local/bin/stilts

# work in this directory
WORKDIR /tmp/build

# add files from the current directory in to the build directory (all the files for the Robbie library)
ADD . /tmp/build

# install python dependencies, with specific versions specified for longevity, and Robbie scripts
# using pip install . will break the shebang lines of some scripts so stick with python setup.py install
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt && \
    python setup.py install && \
    rm -rf /tmp/build

# set the home directory to be /tmp so that we get fewer warnings from python libraries like matplotlib or astropy.
ENV HOME=/tmp
~~~
{: .language-docker}

Note the following from the above:
- We use `apt install -y` to get around the interactive questions that `apt` would normally ask us (answer "yes" to all questions)
- We use the `&&` to string multiple commands together so that we reduce the number of `RUN` statements that we need. This reduces the number of layers that are created.
- We use the line continuation `\` after `&&` to make the file easier to read
- Each of the layers created have a different use: one for 'system' libraries, one for the java library, and one for all the python code.
- We have put the layer that is most likely to change last so that when we remake this container we can make use of previously created layers.

To build the above container we run the following:
~~~
$ docker build -t robbie:new .
...
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Where we used `robbie` as the container name and `new` as the tag.
Typically people use either a version number (eg, v1.0) or `latest` as the tag, but any string will be accepted.

Managing all the binding and container selection can be a bit annoying so you might want to create some shortcuts or aliases for youself.
If you are using a container within a bash script then you can set/use a variable to help you out:
~~~
# setup the container run command once
container='docker run --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/app test'

# ... later on you can use it easily and without making the script hard to read
${container} area_of_ngon.py 4
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Of course, we won't need to mess around with this too much since we'll end up using NextFlow as our workflow manager and NextFlow will handle all the docker calls.

## Making a singularity image
Making singularity containers can be done in much the same way as with Docker (see [here](https://singularity-userdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/container_recipes.html#container-recipes) for info).
However, rather than re-learning all the above for singularity, we can do some rather nice containerisation use to convert our docker containers into Singularity images.

The following docker command will load a docker image (identified by `[image:tag]`) within which singularity has been installed.
It will create a binding/mount for the docker socket so that singularity within the container can talk to the docker damon running on the host machine.
Finally, it will run singularity to convert the existing docker container into a singularity container, saving it in `/output` (which is bound to a directory on your host machine `[destination dir]`).
~~~
docker run \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
-v [destination dir]:/output \
--privileged -t --rm \
singularityware/docker2singularity \
[image:tag]
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The singularity image file (`.sif` or `.img`) that you create with the above command is a portable format that you can move to other machines without having to remake or rebuild.
This means that you can create docker images on your local machine, test and develop until you get things just right, and then use them to create a singularity image which you can copy to an HPC for use by you and others.

## Running singularity containers
Running a singularity container is much like running a docker container, however instead of using the image `name:tag`, you can link directly to the image file.
~~~
singularity run [run options] [image path] [args]
~~~
{: .language-bash}
Where `[run options]` are options for singularity run command, and `[args]` are arguments to the script which is run within the container.

Singularity supports binding files/directories within the container to locations on the host machine, using the `--bind` or `-B` flag.

Singularity offers multiple ways to interact with a container:
- run - launch container an run a predefined script (eg `area_of_ngon.py --help`)
- exec - launch container with custom commands (eg `area_of_ngon.py 4` or `python my_other_script.py`)
- shell - drops you into an interactive shell within the container (similar to exec with `/usr/bin/bash` as args)

> ## Run your singularity image
> If you have access to either Pawsey or OzStar, attempt the following:
> 1. Copy your `test.sif` file to your HPC of choice.
> 2. Login to your HPC
> 3. Use `module load` to load singularity/apptainer
> 4. Try the singularity run/exec/shell commands on your container

Rather than dive deeper into singularity containers, we are going to let NextFlow do all the work for us in the next section.
