## Content

This workshop is designed to give you training in a broad range of skills that will be useful for your career in academia and beyond.
We are not aiming to provide a deep dive into any of the material covered here, but instead will focus on making sure that everyone comes away with enough information to know what skills are useful, what questions to ask, and where to go for more information.

If you are interested in further engagement please see the links within the lessons, the bonus content lesson (not part of the HWSA workshop), chat to us in the breaks, or reach out via email or slack to get some more advice from the ADACS team.

## Engagement

This workshop is developed for three main delivery methods:
1. Facilitated, in person, at the HWSA venue in Tasmania
2. Facilitated, online, in parallel with (1)
3. Self-paced, online, via this website.

For the HWSA school we will set up a shared google doc for people to contribute to as we go along.
This means that contributions can be anonymous and asynchronous as needed.
Whilst we have ADACS people here to facilitate the workshop, we encourage people to ask for help from their peers, and to offer help to those that may need it.

This workshop is all about learning by doing.
We will be engaging in live coding type exercises for most of the workshop, and we will set challenges and exercises for you to complete in groups.
The more you engage with your fellow learners and the more questions that you ask, the more that you will get out of this workshop.

We will be using sticky notes for in-person participants to indicate their readiness to move on: please stick them on your laptop screen to indicate if you need help or are done and ready to move ahead.
For those joining online we'll be using the cross or check icons (zoom) to indicate the same.

We will use a shared document ([etherpad](https://pad.systemli.org/p/hwsa-2022-workshop-tassie)) to manage and record many of our interactions.
